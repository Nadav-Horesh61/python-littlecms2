A paratial (and not fully tested) python-ctype interface to littlecms.
Thid mudule tries to match closely the littlecms functions call convention,
so you can use the littlecms documentation as a guide.

* the lcms2 functions name start with `cms`
* You must call `init()` before being able to use the library function.
  You can optionaly provide the `liblcms2` full path
